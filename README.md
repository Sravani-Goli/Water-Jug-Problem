# Water Jug Problem Solver (AI)

## 🧠 Problem Statement
The Water Jug Problem involves two jugs with fixed capacities and no measurement markings. The objective is to measure an exact amount of water using permitted operations such as filling, emptying, and pouring water between the jugs.

In this project:
- Jug 1 capacity = 4 liters  
- Jug 2 capacity = 3 liters  
- Target amount = 2 liters  

## 🚀 Approach
The solution uses a **state space search** approach.

- Each state represents the current water levels in both jugs.
- The program explores all valid operations:
  - Fill a jug
  - Empty a jug
  - Pour water between jugs
- Previously visited states are tracked to prevent repetition and infinite loops.
- The search continues until the target amount is obtained.

## 🧩 Concepts Used
- Artificial Intelligence Problem Solving  
- State Space Representation  
- Depth-First Search (DFS)  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Graph Traversal  
- Cycle Detection (visited states)

## 🎯 Applications
The Water Jug Problem demonstrates AI search techniques used in:

- resource allocation and planning  
- robotics and automated systems  
- puzzle solving algorithms  
- decision-making systems  
- process optimization and fluid distribution problems
